# Dart Runtime for AWS Lambda **(Sound Null Safety)**

<p align="center">
   A ðŸŽ¯ <a href="https://dart.dev/">Dart</a> Runtime for Æ› <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>
</p>

---

This package is based on the official [aws-lambda-dart-runtime](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-dart-runtime).
It is a restructured version of the outdated official [aws-lambda-dart-runtime](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-dart-runtime) adapted to the latest Dart SDK to make it easier to maintain.

Thanks to [katallaxie](https://github.com/katallaxie) and [AWS Labs](https://github.com/awslabs)
involved in the development of the [original stuff](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-dart-runtime)!

You can read the [official document](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-dart-runtime/blob/master/README.md) too!
